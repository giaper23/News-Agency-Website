# News-Agency-Website

<b>Description</b>:<br>
A News Agency Website featuring a <b>CUSTOM CMS for CRUD operations</b>  (<b>PHP, MySQL</b>)

----------------------------
<b>Info</b>:

I had the exclusive responsibility of building the Back-End while helping our team on the Front-End.
My original plan was to use Laravel but due to complications I had to scrap and rebuild the project without
the help of a framework.
Below is a list of features I built for this project while on tight schedule and under pressure.
